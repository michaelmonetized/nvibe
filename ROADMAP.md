# Nvibe Roadmap

## ðŸš€ v0.1.0

- ðŸš€ Initial release

@ISSUES
 - opening nvimtree balances the window sizes, breaking the layout.

@TODO
 - try opening NVIMTREE and switching back to the editor before we start splitting and launching terms
 - create a roadmap
 - make bottom panel commands and sizes configurable
 - try watching for <leader>e and counter-acting the window balancing it does
 - test with minimap
 - rename success/err vars and function left_top, left_bottom, bottom_left, bottom_middle, bottom_right to remove ambiguity from the dx
 - add more documentation to the plugin init.lua file.
 - update the README.md file with the new features and usage.
 - add a screenshot to the README.md file.
 - update docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md with the new features and usage.
